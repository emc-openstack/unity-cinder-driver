  - Dell EMC Unity Cinder driver allows enabling/disabling the SSL verification.
    Admin can set `True` or `False` for `driver_ssl_cert_verify` to enable
    or disable this function, alternatively set the
    `driver_ssl_cert_path=<PATH>` for customized CA path.
    Both above 2 options should go under the driver section.
