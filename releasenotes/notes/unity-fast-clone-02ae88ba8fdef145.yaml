features:
  - Add thin clone support in the Unity driver. Unity storage supports the thin
    clone of a LUN from OE version 4.2.0. It is more efficient than the dd
    solution. However, there is a limit of thin clone inside
    each LUN family. Every time the limit reaches, a new LUN family will be
    created by a dd-copy, and then the volume clone afterward will use the
    thin clone of the new LUN family.
